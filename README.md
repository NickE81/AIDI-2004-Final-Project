# Final Project - Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
### This package will contain all the files for my AI in Enterprise Systems course, which is an application that uses a Sentiment Analysis model to predict the
### labelling of a movie, either fresh or rotten (like rotten tomatoes does) based on the text review of the movie.
### The dataset is a csv file containing reviews and labels retrieved from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w1TsJB-gmIkZ28d1j7sf1sqcPmHXw352/view
### The code is currently written in a jupyter notebook file, and will soon have a python flask file, HTML, CSS, and will be hosted on Heroku.
