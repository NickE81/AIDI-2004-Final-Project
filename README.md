# Final Project - Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
### This package will contain all the files for my AI in Enterprise Systems course, which is an application that uses a Sentiment Analysis model to predict the
### labelling of a movie, either fresh or rotten (like rotten tomatoes does) based on the text review of the movie.

### The dataset is a csv file containing reviews and labels retrieved from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w1TsJB-gmIkZ28d1j7sf1sqcPmHXw352/view

### The code is currently written in a python flask file, HTML, and CSS. There is also a jupyter notebook file and the app is hosted on Heroku.

### The python packages used in this repository are:
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit learn
* tensorflow
* keras
* flask
* matplotlib
* pickle

### This application can be run locally by copying the contents of this repository, running 'pip install -r requirements.txt', and then running 'python FlaskApp.py', or run on Heroku using the following link: https://aidi-2004-final.herokuapp.com/
